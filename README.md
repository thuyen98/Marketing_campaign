RFM Analysis: A Goldmine for Customer Segmentation
Understanding customer behavior and identifying the target audience are essential for successful marketing campaigns. 
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a powerful tool to achieve this goal.

In this article, we explore RFM analysis using the Online Retail II UCI dataset. We demonstrate how to segment customers based on three key attributes: 

Recency: The time since the customer's last purchase. 

Frequency: The number of purchases made by the customer.

Monetary: The total amount spent by the customer. 

Segmenting customers based on these attributes enables businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.
